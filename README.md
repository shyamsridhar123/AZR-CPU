# Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) - CPU Implementation

🧠 **A revolutionary self-bootstrapping AI system where a language model teaches itself to reason from scratch**

The AZR system demonstrates how AI can achieve reasoning capabilities starting from minimal knowledge, using only 3 simple seed tasks to bootstrap complex reasoning abilities through self-generated curriculum learning.

## 🎯 What AZR Does

### **Core Innovation: Self-Teaching Reasoning**

AZR implements a groundbreaking approach where a language model:

1. **🌱 Starts with minimal knowledge** - Just 3 basic seed tasks (addition, multiplication, string operations)
2. **🎲 Generates its own learning curriculum** - Creates new reasoning tasks autonomously  
3. **🔄 Learns from success AND failure** - Uses dual reward signals to improve both task generation and problem solving
4. **📈 Auto-adjusts difficulty** - Maintains optimal challenge level (≈50% success rate) for maximum learning

### **🚀 What Happens When You Run `python main.py`**

The system executes a sophisticated **TRR++ (Task-Reward-Reasoning)** algorithm in three phases:

#### **Phase 1: PROPOSE** 🎯
- Model generates new reasoning tasks (lambda functions + test cases)
- Tasks validated through safe code execution in sandboxed environment
- **Proposer Reward**: `r_propose = 1 - |success_rate - 0.5|` (rewards "learnable" tasks)

#### **Phase 2: SOLVE** 🧠  
- Model attempts to solve tasks sampled from growing task buffer
- Solutions verified through automated code execution
- **Solver Reward**: `r_solve = 1.0 if correct else 0.0` (binary accuracy)

#### **Phase 3: UPDATE** 📈
- Model weights updated using combined reward signals
- Task difficulty automatically adjusted based on performance
- Progress logged, checkpoints saved, curriculum evolved

### **🔍 Three Types of Reasoning Mastered**

1. **Deduction** 📝: Given program + input → predict output
   ```python
   Program: lambda x: x * 2 + 1
   Input: 5
   Output: 11  # Model learns to execute programs mentally
   ```

2. **Abduction** 🔍: Given input + output → discover program  
   ```python
   Input: 5
   Output: 11
   Program: lambda x: x * 2 + 1  # Model learns to reverse-engineer logic
   ```

3. **Induction** 🧩: Given examples → synthesize general pattern
   ```python
   Examples: (1,3), (2,5), (3,7), (4,9)
   Pattern: lambda x: x * 2 + 1  # Model learns to find underlying rules
   ```

**Detailed Learning Cycle:**

1. **🎯 PROPOSE Phase** (Task Generation)
   - Model receives role-specific prompt: "Generate a challenging reasoning task..."
   - Creates lambda function, input values, and expected outputs
   - System validates syntax, safety, and executability
   - Task added to appropriate buffer (deduction/abduction/induction)

2. **🧠 SOLVE Phase** (Problem Solving)  
   - Random task sampled from buffer (weighted by difficulty)
   - Model receives problem in appropriate format
   - Attempts to solve using learned reasoning patterns
   - Solution verified through automated execution

3. **📈 UPDATE Phase** (Learning)
   - Proposer reward encourages generating "learnable" tasks (50% success rate)
   - Solver reward reinforces correct problem-solving behavior
   - Model weights updated using gradient ascent on combined rewards
   - Learning rate adaptively adjusted based on performance

4. **📊 CURRICULUM Phase** (Difficulty Adjustment)
   - Success rates monitored across task types
   - Task complexity automatically increased/decreased
   - Buffer management: remove trivial/impossible tasks
   - Maintain optimal challenge level for continued learning

### **🎭 Task Types & Examples**

#### **📝 Deduction Tasks** (Forward Reasoning)
*Given: Program + Input → Predict: Output*

```python
# Example 1: Basic arithmetic
Task: "Execute lambda x: x * 3 + 2 with input 4"
Model learns: 4 * 3 + 2 = 14

# Example 2: String manipulation  
Task: "Execute lambda s: s.upper()[:3] with input 'hello'"
Model learns: 'hello' → 'HELLO' → 'HEL'

# Example 3: Complex logic
Task: "Execute lambda x: x if x > 10 else x * 2 with input 8"
Model learns: 8 ≤ 10, so output is 8 * 2 = 16
```

#### **🔍 Abduction Tasks** (Reverse Engineering)

# Example 3: Conditional logic
Given: Input=15, Output=15; Input=7, Output=14
Model discovers: lambda x: x if x > 10 else x * 2
```

#### **🧩 Induction Tasks** (Pattern Synthesis)
